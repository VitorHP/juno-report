# Juno Reports

A simple, but efficient, YAML based report generator

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'juno-report'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install juno-report

## Usage

The generating reports is based on a YAML file with all rules, wiht the fields and their settings.

Rules are divided by sections, and the basic structure to generates a report is:

```yaml
# example.yml
body:
  settings: {posY: 40, height: 25}
  fields:
    test_field1: [10]
    test_field2: [220]
    test_field3: [450, {column: "Named Test Field 3"}]
  footer:
    label_total: [5, {text: "Total"}]
    totalizer: [200, {behavior: count}]
    campo4: [450, {behavior: sum}]
```
The [body] section represents the record which will be iterated to report generating and ***must*** have more three rules:

* `settings (required)`: Defines some configurations for body, like their height and ypos.
* `fields (required)`: Describes each field of record to be iterated.
* `footer (required)`: Drawn at the end of all printed records and calculates fields according behavior parameter.

You may want to print a title every time that a page is created. You simply insert a [page] section. 

The [page] section have follow rules:

* `fields`: 

```ruby
pdf = Prawml::PDF.new('path_to_yaml/example.yml')
pdf.generate({
    :text1 => 'Prawml',
    :text2 => 'The pdf generator',
    :barcode1 => 'My little barcode string'
}).render_file('example.pdf')
```
You can also pass an object that responds to methods described in YAML file.

### Available options:

* `type`: **text|image|barcode** *[text]*
* `color`: **RGB color** *[00000]*
* `fixed`: **A fixed text. Ignores values and renders the static text informed** *[false]*

##### Text specific options:
* `font`: **Any Prawn supported font can be used** *[Times-Roman]*
* `align`: **left|center|right** *[left]*
* `size`: **float** *[12]*
* `style`: **bold|normal|italic|bold_italic** *[normal]*
* `format`: **Formating hooks** (currency|date) *[false]*
